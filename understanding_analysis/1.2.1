a. Prove that sqrt(3) is irrational. Does a similar argument hold for sqrt(6)?
b. Where does the proof of Theorem 1.1.1 break down if we try to use it to
prove sqrt(4) is irrational?

a.
Assume for contradiction that sqrt(3) is rational.

That is, it can be expressed as the irreducible ratio of two nonzero integers
p and q:

sqrt(3) = p / q
3 = (p / q)^2
3 = (p^2) / (q^2)
(1) 3 * q^2 = p^2

Therefore 3 is a factor of p^2

By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, p can be written as a finite product
of a unique increasing sequence of prime numbers:

p = a * b * ...
p^2 = a * a * b * b * ...

Since 3 is a factor of p^2, and it has no prime factors other than itself, it must appear
in this product. But each prime factor must appear at least twice in this list. Therefore 3
occurs at least twice. Rearranging, we get that

p^2 = 3 * 3 * a * a * b * b * ...

p = 3 * a * b * ...

Therefore there is a number s = a * b * ... such that p = 3 * s, and p^2 = 3 * 3 * s^2

From (1) we have that 3 * q^2 = p^2 = 3 * 3 * s^2

therefore q^2 = 3 * s^2, so q^2 is also divisible by 3. But we specified
that p and q were irreducible, and therefore they cannot both be divisible
by 3. Having reached a contradiction, we reject the assumption that sqrt(3) is rational.

A similar argument would hold for sqrt(6), but would be more steps since 6 itself
is not prime and would need to be decomposed into 3 and 2.


b.
4 has a prime factorization of 2 * 2. p^2 can therefore be divisible by 4 without p being divisible
by 4.
