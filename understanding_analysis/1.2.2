Prove that There is no rational number r such that 2^r = 3

Assume, for contradiction, that there is a rational number r = p / q
such that 2^r = 3, and p and q are natural numbers sharing no common
factors. Then,

      2^(p/q) = 3
      (2^(p/q))^q = 3^q
 (1)  2^p = 3^q

2^p and 3^q are both natural numbers that can be expressed as
the finite products 2*2*2...*2 and 3*3*3...*3 respetively
(since p and q are also natural numbers). Both 2^p and 3^q can
be expressed uniquely as a product of prime numbers, and since 2 and
3 are both primes, the given factorizations are the _only_
factorizations. Since these factorizations are not equal, 2^p and
3^q are not equal. But this contradicts (1).

Having reached a contradiction, we are forced to accept that our
assumption is false.
